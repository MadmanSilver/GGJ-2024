Thoughts/Vibes:
- B/W Slapstick Comedy theme
- Slapstick horror
- Different kinds of laughter (nervous, evil, etc.)
- Performer/troup management (like The Amazing American Circus)
- Kid v Neighbor. Neighbor is crazy or kid annoys neighbor. (Tom & Jerry, Home Alone)

Ideas:
- Slapstick tower defense. Use slapstick comedy tropes (think banana peel) to stop waves of characters.

- King and his jester. Simulation/puzzle game like Game Dev Tycoon. You need to develop your acts/performances based on limited feedback from your king. If your favorability falls too low, you get executed. Roguelike.

- Bard RPG. You play a young bard adventuring through the land to make people laugh. NPC interactions are charisma-based, trying to make them like you via laughter. Battles (with other bards or adventurers) would be effectively Viscious Mockery from D&D. The major story checkpoints would be boss battles against your father's various children from his years on the road.

- Curse collector. Player goes around the city learning new curse words to use against people in arguments/battles. If enough people get angry, it basically turns into Party Animals style physics brawler.

- <someone important> has lost their smile. short silly quest to retrieve ingredients to make laughter potion.

- platformer where you are on a giant beast and shaking the environment through causing it's laughter is a solution. Use environment to figure out more and more new ways to make the beast laugh.

- Point and click puzzler where you must cause some chain reactions/chaos to progress the world

- You are a hyena who has trouble laughing, but need to laugh to call your pack. Maybe it's a series of unfortunate events causing you to be unable to laugh. Loop is solving puzzles to find a solution to the current predicament, but ending up in another immediately after.
